# ReinforcementLearningProject
It is projects for reinforcement learning.

##Introduction

The total final project is divided into 2 parts, part 1 is Value-Based Algorithms tested in different environments based on the project requirement paper. 

## Atari Project ( Part 1)

###Step 1: 
open the folder 'AtariTask'.
###Step 2: 
open the Terminal(Powershell or Bash) in this folder, enter "python run.py --env_name BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4"(for example).
###Warnings: 
Different environment offers different image with different format. Therefore there may be some mistake in preprocess of the input. You just need to adjust it if there is an error.


## Mujoco Project (Part 2)

###Step 1: 
open the folder 'MujocoTask'
###Step 2: 
open the terminal and enter "python run.py --env_name YourEnvName" to train a new model.
